Adapted from https://ai.google.dev/docs/semantic_retriever. Users will need to follow the instructions in the link to set up a Google Cloud account and install the necessary libraries.

1. Import the necessary libraries. 
2. Load the corpus of papers as a list of strings. 
3. Use the Google Gemini API to retrieve the most relevant sentences from the corpus for a given question. 
4. Use the attributed question answering model to extract the relevant information from the retrieved sentences.

6. Save the table as a CSV file for further analysis or visualization.
